# Story Generator (Node.js)

Run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3030 and use the UI. When you click **Next**, the server will save two JSON files into `/data` and create a ZIP containing those files plus a small preview. The UI will show a link to download that ZIP.
